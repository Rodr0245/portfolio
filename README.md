# Portfolio - Nicolas Rodriguez Ortiz


## My Development Process

### Design and Planning
- **Wireframing:** Initiated the process by sketching wireframes to plan the layout and structure of my portfolio.
- **Design Tools:** Utilized Figma for creating design mockups, focusing on both user experience and developer feasibility.

### Technology Used
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript:** 
- **Bootstrap 5:** Utilized Bootstrap for its time-saving features, although faced challenges in combining it smoothly with custom elements.
- **Custom CSS:** Overcame Bootstrap limitations by incorporating custom CSS to achieve specific design elements and responsive solutions.
- **Font Awesome:** Integrated Font Awesome for easy management of fonts and additional icons.
- **AOS Library:** Implemented the AOS library for scroll-triggered animations ([AOS Library](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/)).

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Bootstrap Flexibility
- **Issue:** Working creatively outside Bootstrap's framework proved challenging.
- **Solution:** Integrated vanilla CSS to achieve specific design elements that Bootstrap couldn't easily accommodate.

### Challenge 2: Bootstrap Grid System
- **Issue:** Bootstrap's grid system posed challenges when requiring custom sizing for images within the same grid.
- **Solution:** Modified the design of the photo gallery, incorporating custom CSS for precise control over image dimensions.

## Lessons Learned

- **Designer-Developer Communication:** Acknowledged the importance of effective communication between designers and developers. Now design with both user and developer perspectives in mind.
- **Research and Time:** Realized that even a portfolio website demands thorough research and significant time investment.
